#### n, other ![rumus kedua](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20n%5E%7B2%7D) and one with complexity nlog(n)

## LAILA-ABBAS-ASSIGNMENT-3

#### Find common numbers 
#### Once by java already-made arrayList
#### The other time is by implementing arrayList by hand

## LAILA-ABBAS-ASSIGNMENT-4

#### Type casting of integer to string 

## LAILA-ABBAS-ASSIGNMENT-5

#### It's main objective is to implement Encapsulation principle
#### Designing a parking lot. The lot has multiple parking spots, each parking spot can fit compact (Toyota yaris) or regular(Toyota corola) car. 
#### When a car is parked, a ticket is issued  that indicates the start time. The parking lot should have a red sign turned on if the parking lot is full.
#### A compact car can be parked in regular spot if all compact spots are occupied, the opposite is not valid.

## LAILA-ABBAS-ASSIGNMENT-6

#### It's main objective is to implement inheritance and polymorphism principles.
#### Design automated supermarket to buy desire amounts of candies 
#### and to calculate their total money cost

## LAILA-ABBAS-ASSIGNMENT-7

#### Final project to apply all OOP concepts
#### Design a Vending Machine which follows following requirements:
####     Accepts coins of 1,5,10,25, 50 Cents i.e. penny, nickel, dime, and quarter as well as 1 and 2 dollar note
####     Allow user to select products e.g. CANDY(10), SNACK(50), NUTS(90), Coke(25), Pepsi(35), Soda(45)
####     Allow user to take refund by canceling the request.
####     The user can select more than one item per transaction
####     The user can query the vending machine to display the inventory available from each item.
